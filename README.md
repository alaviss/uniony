# uniony ![Github Actions](https://github.com/tandy-1000/uniony/workflows/Github%20Actions/badge.svg)

A [jsony](https://github.com/treeform/jsony/) plugin to enable [union](https://github.com/alaviss/union) support.

`nimble install https://github.com/tandy-1000/uniony`

---
### Why?

To help create high level bindings for APIs built in TypeScript where type unions are used. I needed this in [listenbrainz-nim](https://gitlab.com/tandy1000/listenbrainz-nim/).
